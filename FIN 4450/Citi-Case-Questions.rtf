\f0\fs24 \cf0 3. In what areas did Citibank see the most benefit in integrating fintech solutions?\
\
Citibank was able to enjoy multiple benefits throughout its different lines of business from evolving to a Fintech firm including customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, cost savings and competitive advantage. Innovation in the smart phone industry allowed firms to utilize biometrics to verify a customer, before granting access digitally through the app, by using a fingerprint; Citibank went further by including voice recognition for its automated phone service and face recognition for select branch services. The ease of use and convenience was highly revered by Citi\'92s clientele and proved to be a very successful investment. Not to mention, the extra layer of security reduced the risk of human error which reduced any complaints addressed with privacy concerns. Upgrading Citi\'92s internal technological infrastructure also expedited processes within the bank including credit risk management. Credit decisions were made available real-time compared to waiting for a few days to weeks to receive approval. This results not only in increased customer satisfaction but a reduction in costs from a more streamlined process. }
